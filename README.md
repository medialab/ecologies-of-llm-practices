The **Écologies des Pratiques LLM (EL2MP)** project explores the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on research, creativity and communication across a wide range of domains. Developed using SvelteKit, this initiative brings together cutting-edge technological tools and a critical reflection to better understand their impact and implications. Supported by Google, this project is committed to advancing ethical and impactful AI practices.

## Project Overview

At the heart of this project lies a **collaborative and interdisciplinary approach**, engaging researchers, practitioners and students to experiment with LLMs. from diverse fields. It aims to:

- Investigate the potential of LLMs as catalysts for new forms of knowledge production and dissemination
- Address ethical and ecological challenges raised by their integration
- Foster communities of practice for shared experimentation and reflection

## Key Focus Areas:

### 1. Technological Experimentation

Exploring how LLMs reshape the academic and professional practices they are integrated into. From creative writing to data analysis, the project tests the boundaries of LLMs' generative capabilities.

### 2. Critical Reflection

Fostering dialogue on the broader societal and ecological implications of LLM integration:

- What are the costs and benefits of scaling these technologies?
- How do they challenge or reinforce pre-existing knowledge systems and power structures?

### 3. Community Building

Building a community of thinkers and makers through workshops, public events, and collaborative platforms to collectively imagine and shape the future of AI-driven practices.

## Technology Highlights

This project leverages modern web technologies to create an interactive and engaging experience:

- **Framework:** Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and efficient user interface.
- **Interactivity:** Uses [Interact.js](https://interactjs.io/) for dynamic element manipulation.
- **Custom Components:** Features bespoke Svelte components tailored to the project's needs.
- **Key Libraries:** Incorporates libraries like [Simplebar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar) for custom scrolling and optionally [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for graphical elements.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows standard [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) conventions:

- Routes: Located in `src/routes`
- Shared utilities and components: `src/lib`
- Content management: Likely handled via `Content_data.js` and integrated server-side or within components

## Project Support

With support from Google, **Écologies des Pratiques LLM** critically investigates the role of LLMs in shaping contemporary ecological, cultural and institutional systems. By bridging technological innovation and critical inquiry, this project seeks to explore how this intersection can pave the way for a responsible, more sustainable and inclusive future.
